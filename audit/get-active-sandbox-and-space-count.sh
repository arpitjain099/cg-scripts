# Provides counts for the following:
# - The total number of sandbox spaces currently in the platform
# - The number of current active sandboxes in the platform
# - Optionally provides the number of sandbox spaces created within a certain
#   timeframe given any provided dates or date range

# An active sandbox is defined as any user's sandbox space with 1 or more
# running apps in it.  Sandboxes are cleared out every 90 days from the time of
# first activity, so we can only ever count what is currently running.  That
# said, we can determine these counts by using the cf CLI and CAPI to retrieve
# all sandbox orgs, then filter a list of all apps with those corresponding org
# GUIDs.

# Sandbox spaces are defined as any space within a sandbox organization, e.g.,
# all spaces under the sandbox-gsa org.

# Help information for this script.

A script that provides counts for the following:

- The total number of sandbox spaces currently in the platform

- The number of current active sandboxes in the platform

- Optionally provides the number of sandbox spaces created within a certain
  timeframe given any provided dates or date range


Usage: ${0##*/} [--start-date START_DATE] [--end-date END_DATE]

    -?, -h, --help  Display this help message and exit

    --start-date    Retrieve an additional count of sandbox spaces that were
                    created at or after the provided start date; must be in
                    YYYY-MM-DD format

    --end-date      Retrieve an additional count of sandbox spaces that were
                    created at or before the provided end date; must be in
                    YYYY-MM-DD format

Including both the --start-date and --end-date arguments will restrict the
additional sandbox space count to the date range provided with both dates.
