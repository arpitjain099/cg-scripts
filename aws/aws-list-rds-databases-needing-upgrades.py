# Purpose: Scrape the AWS RDS endpoints for the list of of databases and retrieve the list of RDS instances
#          needing upgrades to the instance family or db engine
# Prerequisites:
#  - Use aws-vault if running locally
#  - `cf login` into production CF
# Usage: python3 aws-list-rds-databases-needing-upgrades.py
# Environment variables:
#  - CSV_FILE_NAME: The results are written to a csv file, the default is "idle_db.csv"
#  - SYSTEM_DOMAIN: CF system domain, default is pointed to production with the value "fr.cloud.gov"
