# For the tooling and production jumpboxes:
#   Login to each jumpbox and take note of the container number.
#   Run: 
#     python3 cg-scripts/generate-POAM-inventory.py > inv.csv 
#   then exit.
#   Copy the CSV to your local clipboard by running :
#     fly -t ci i -j "jumpbox/container-bosh-{environment}" -s jumpbox -b "{container-number}" -- cat inv.csv | pbcopy
#   where {environment} is production or tooling and container-number is the number from the first step.

# goal: produce a CSV with lines of:
# `Unique Asset Identifier` - can be any arbitrary name - we use the VM name with BOSH ID
# IPv4 - hopefully obvious what this means
# IPv6 - we don't currently include this
# DNS name - not currently included
# NetBIOS name - not currently included
# MAC Address - not currently included
# Asset Weight - always 5
# Authenticated Scan - always 'Agent Based'
# Baseline Configuration Name - always Ubuntu Stemcell
# OS Name[ - e.g. Ubuntu
# OS Version - e.g. 14.04.1
# Location - Cloud Provider's Availability zone name
# Asset type - what it is (e.g. EC2)
# Virtual - is it a VM
# Public - is it public-internet-facing
# In latest scan - is it supposed to be in the latest scan (yes)
# Comment - optional comments
#

# call out the ones we don't use, so they're easier to replace if we do use them
# use empty string rather than None to make printing easier later
